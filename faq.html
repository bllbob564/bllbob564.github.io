                            <h4>How does BDS help the Palestinian struggle for freedom, justice and equality?</h4><br />
                            <p>The BDS movement aims to end international complicity in the Israeli regime of occupation, apartheid and settler colonialism.
Many companies such as Orange, Veolia and CRH have pulled out of Israel as a result of BDS campaigns.
As Israeli corporations, institutions and organizations become isolated or suffer economic setbacks due to international BDS campaigns, Israel, including business and society, will find it more difficult to maintain its oppression of Palestinians.
Each BDS success generates media attention and shines a light on the just Palestinian struggle for rights. The BDS movement is leading a tidal change in perceptions and approaches to Israel's regime of oppression.
The growth and success of the BDS movement send a clear message of hope and inspiration to Palestinians and others that public opinion is increasingly supportive of the Palestinian people. The Israeli government now recognizes the potential of the BDS movement as a "strategic threat" to its system of injustice.

                            <h4>How widely supported is the BDS movement internationally?</h4><br />
                            <p>The 2005 Palestinian call for BDS against Israel has triggered a massive response from people of conscience and civil society organisations across the world.
BDS campaigns are supported by scores of unions, churches, NGOs and movements representing millions across every continent. Progressive Jewish groups and conscientious Jewish-Israeli groups, play an important role in the movement.
Public figures like Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Naomi Klein, Roger Waters, Angela Davis and Judith Butler back BDS.
Corporations, banks and investment funds now adopt the logic of BDS with some starting to divest their money from Israel's occupation.
BDS leads major news headlines and is shaping how the Palestinian cause is perceived in public. BDS is leading a tidal change in support of justice for Palestinians.

                            <h4>What is the Boycott, Divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement?</h4><br />
                            <p>Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) is a Palestinian-led, global movement for freedom, justice and equality. BDS upholds the simple principle that Palestinians are entitled to the same rights as the rest of humanity.
BDS is inspired and inspiring. It draws inspiration from decades of Palestinian popular resistance, from the South African anti-apartheid struggle, from the US Civil Rights movement, among other others. It inspires Palestinians and supporters of Palestinian rights worldwide to speak truth to power, to challenge hegemonic, racist power structures and to assert that Palestinian rights must be respected and implemented.  
Israel is occupying and colonising Palestinian land, discriminating against Palestinian citizens of Israel and denying Palestinian refugees the right to return to their homes. It is maintaining a regime of occupation, settler-colonialism and apartheid over the Palestinian people.
World governments fail to hold Israel to account. Companies and institutions help Israel to oppress Palestinians. In response, Palestinians are calling for nonviolent grassroots boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) campaigning against Israel.
Inspired by the South African anti-apartheid movement, the BDS call urges action to pressure Israel to comply with international law by:
1. Ending its occupation and colonization of all Arab lands and dismantling the Wall
International law recognises the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Gaza and the Syrian Golan Heights as occupied by Israel.
2. Granting Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel their right to full equality
3. Respecting, protecting and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN resolution 194
Ten years since its launch, BDS is now widely supported by unions, academic associations, churches and movements across the world.
As a result of BDS pressure, major companies, such as Veolia, Orange and CRH are withdrawing from the Israeli market after following campaigns over their involvement in Israeli projects that violate international law. The UN and the World Bank say that BDS is starting to have a significant economic impact. Thousands of artists including major celebrities like Roger Waters and Lauryn Hill now refuse to play in Israel.
Israel is increasingly worried that the BDS movement is making it a pariah state in the way that South Africa once was.

                            <h4>What does BDS aim to achieve? Does it call for a one state or two state solution?</h4><br />
                            <p>The BDS movement aims to pressure Israel to respect international law by:<br />
1. Ending its occupation and colonization of all Arab lands and dismantling the Wall
International law recognises the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Gaza and the Syrian Golan Heights as occupied by Israel.<br />
2. Recognizing the fundamental rights of the Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality.<br />
3. Respecting, protecting and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN resolution 194.<br />
These are three basic rights without which the Palestinian people cannot exercise its inalienable right to self-determination.
The BDS movement does not advocate for a particular solution to the conflict and does not call for either a "one state solution" or a "two state solution". Instead, BDS focuses on the realization of basic rights and the implementation of international law.

                            <h4>What has the BDS movement achieved so far?</h4><br />
                            <p>Thanks to the strategic campaigning of people and organisations all over the world, the global BDS movement is having a real impact. For example:
                            <ol class="list-in-content">
                                <li>BDS was a major factor behind the 46% drop in foreign direct investment in Israel in 2014, according to a UN report. A Rand Corporation study predicts BDS could reduce Israel's GDP "by 1 to 2 percent" annually over the next 10 years, while a World Bank report reveals that Israel's exports to the Palestinian
                                economy have dropped by 24% in the first quarter of 2015.</li>
                                <li>French multinational Veolia has completely withdrawn from Israel after a BDS campaign over its role in Israel's colonisation of Palestinian land cost it billions of dollars in lost contracts.</li>
                                <li>Top Israeli weapons manufacturers complain of a plummeting exports "crisis," partly due to "less desire for Israeli-made products."</li>
                                <li>Major international companies including Orange, G4S and Unilever have announced steps to end their participation in Israel's crimes.</li>
                                <li>Thousands of artists including Roger Waters from Pink Floyd, Faithless, Lauryn Hill, Brian Eno and Elvis Costello have refused to play in Israel.</li>
                                <li>Academic associations and student unions, most notably in the US, Canada, South Africa and the UK, now support BDS. Several churches have divested from companies involved in Israel's occupation.</li>
                                <li>Israel regards BDS as a "strategic threat" to its ongoing oppression of Palestinians. Some Israelis are calling for modest changes to Israeli policy.</li>
                                </ol>

                            </p>
                            
                        </li>
                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                            <li>
                            
                            <h4>Is BDS legal?</h4><br />
                            <p>
                                The BDS movement aims to end international complicity in the Israeli regime of occupation, apartheid and settler colonialism.
                                The BDS movement adopts a legal and analytical framework based on international law. The goal of the movement is to pressure Israel to
                                comply with international law and recognize Palestinian rights. The legitimacy of BDS pressure tactics is time-honored and guaranteed under democratic principles and the principle
                                of freedom of expression.
                                Boycott for political, economic and social change is regarded by the US Supreme Court, for instance, as speech that is protected by the First
                                Amendment of the US Constitution. However, Israeli officials and lobby organizations are hard at work to outlaw BDS and undermine the right to protest
                                Israel's crimes using the nonviolent tactics of BDS. While most of the legal warfare, or lawfare, efforts by Israel have fallen flat, there are worrying trends in some countries.

                          <li>
                            
                            <h4>Doesn't an academic boycott of Israel undermine academic freedom and silence progressive Israeli academics?</h4><br />
                            <p>
                                The BDS movement subscribes to the internationally-accepted definition of academic freedom as adopted by the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (UNESCR).
                                The academic boycott is a boycott of complicit Israeli academic institutions not individuals.
                                Israeli universities play a key role in designing, implementing and whitewashing Israel's crimes against the Palestinian people. Israeli academic institutions plan Israel's discriminatory policies and
                                are deeply involved in the development of the technology and techniques used to violently oppress the Palestinian people
                                (see examples here).
                                During Israel's 2014 attack on Gaza, a tower at the University of Haifa was lit up as the Israeli flag to "express solidarity with Israeli soldiers".

                          <li>
                            
                            <h4>Isn't there a risk that BDS will strengthen right wing politicians in Israel?</h4><br />
                            <p>
                                Like any colonial society that is not held accountable for its crimes, Israel has shifted to the far right in recent years.
                                The current government is Israel's most racist and extremist ever. This is due to many factors, but nonviolent Palestinian
                                resistance and international solidarity with it can hardly be counted among the top of these.
                                A small and gradually growing number of Israelis and Israeli organizations support BDS. They understand that BDS
                                is needed to pressure Israel to comply with international law and to make clear to ordinary Israelis that Israel's occupation
                                and apartheid system is widely opposed.
                                Israeli business leaders and politicians are warning that the boycott is starting to isolate Israel, and some are responding
                                to the growth of BDS by calling for modest policy changes.
                                There's a real fear within Israel that it is becoming the pariah state that South Africa once was. This is leading some Israelis
                                to question whether Israeli apartheid is sustainable in the long term.
                                The way in which the UN, the international community and governments have failed to hold Israel to account for its actions is a principle
                                reason why extreme anti-Palestinian ideas have become more popular in Israel. BDS seeks to address this impunity and lack of accountability

                            <p>
                               BDS does not call for an end to Israel. Rather, it calls for an end to Israel's 1967 occupation of Palestine that went beyond
                               the Internationally recognized borders of Israel. Unfortunately, many times BDS goals are construed and misrepresented by those who speak
                               out against BDS.
                                Omar Barghouti, co-founder of the Palestinian BDS movement, said the following: "The BDS Call was issued by representatives of
                                Palestinian civil society on July 9, 2005 with a goal of achieving basic Palestinian rights under international law. BDS calls for an
                                end to Israel's 1967 occupation of Arab lands, including East Jerusalem; an end to what even the US Department of State has criticized
                                as Israel's system of "institutional, legal and societal discrimination" against its Palestinian citizens, which meets the UN definition
                                of apartheid, and an end to its denial of the Palestinian refugees' UN-stipulated right to return to their homes of origin from which they
                                were forcibly displaced in the 1948 Nakba and kept from returning to ever since." [1]

                            <h4>Why is it problematic to adopt the State Definition of Anti-Semitism? Shouldn't the Jewish community have the right to self-define bigotry against their community?</h4><br />
                            <p>
                                Anti-Semitism - hatred, violence, intimidation or discrimination targeting Jews because of their
                                ethnic and religious identity - is a serious phenomenon that must be addressed. In the context of activism
                                for Palestinian rights, we are seeing a surge of accusations of anti-Semitism against individuals that
                                criticize the Israeli state. Some groups are pushing to redefine anti-Semitism, and codify an overbroad
                                definition that would include advocacy to hold Israel accountable for violations of Palestinian human rights.
                                Classifying criticism of Israel as "anti-Semitic" works to circumscribe important political speech
                                activities, often in violation of the First Amendment. It is also disingenuous and misleading; it does a
                                great disservice to Jewish victims of genuine anti-Semitism by diluting and confusing the term. The
                                re-definition brands critics of Israel and advocates for Palestinian human rights as anti-Semitic by
                                blurring the important distinction between criticism of Israel as a nation-state and anti-Semitism. [2]

                            <h4>As students, how does it help for us to take a political position?</h4><br />
                            <p>
                              Since our University is indirectly invested in these companies, we are automatically taking a political
                              position. By choosing to divest, our University would be taking a neutral stance in the conflict while
                              establishing its position of non-acceptance of human rights violations.
                              Additionally, our University has a Social Responsibility Investments clause in their Endowments
                              Funds policy that calls on the Board of Regents to seek out "investments that support sustainability
                              and [refuse] to invest in weapons, tobacco, or engage in unethical business practices." As the
                              investments in the four companies we have specified do not follow the SRI, it is our responsibility
                              to ask that we divest.
