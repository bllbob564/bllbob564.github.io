				<h4>CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BORDER CONTROL</h4> <br />
				<p>

<body>
<p><strong></strong>Since 1987 states’ corrections spending has more than doubled, while higher education spending has barely grown. Over a period of thirty <g class="gr_ gr_55 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="55" data-gr-id="55">years</g> the U.S prison population has risen by 700%. Nearly half of all inmates in state prisons are locked up for nonviolent offenses (a testament to the <g class="gr_ gr_41 gr-alert gr_spell gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="41" data-gr-id="41">so called</g> “War on Drugs”). This phenomenon of growing arrest and conviction rates, known as mass incarceration, particularly affects poor communities of color. Mass incarceration has been enabled by policing policies such as stop and frisk that have given law enforcement a legal pretext to kidnap hundreds of thousands of young people, pressing them into service in the prison industry.</p>
<p>Incarcerated workers are frequently denied their basic rights, forced to work for ten times less than the already unlivable federal minimum wage while private corporations profit by the cheap labor and high markup for goods and services they charge to inmates. Recidivism rates show the carceral system does not aim to rehabilitate, it aims to force the most vulnerable within our society into an inescapable cycle of poverty and exploitation by the state.</p>
<p>This industry that surrounds “border security” extends beyond the walls of the detention centers, with Israeli companies such as Elbit supplying the surveillance systems that U.S Homeland Security uses to hunt down people who attempt to cross the border. This same border which has led to the internment of thousands of people has only existed for the past hundred <g class="gr_ gr_58 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="58" data-gr-id="58">years,</g> but has in that time undermined indigenous claims to the land that go back thousands of years. The arbitrary placement of borders by European colonial powers is a commonly repeated theme throughout history, including that of Palestine. Furthermore, the same methods used to limit the freedom of movement of Palestinians in the West <g class="gr_ gr_59 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="59" data-gr-id="59">Bank,</g>  has been used on the U.S-Mexico border.</p>

				<h4>TRANSNATIONAL LABOR SOLIDARITY</h4> <br />
				<p>
<body>
<p>Neoliberal reforms of the last thirty years have led to a more interconnected global economy but <g class="gr_ gr_77 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="77" data-gr-id="77">has</g> also contributed to the growth of massive multi-national corporations. They have magnified the threat of “job outsourcing”, which has been used to reverse many of the labor gains achieved in the U.S over the last sixty years. Wealth inequality has more than tripled since 1980, while real wages and union membership continue to decline. The bottom poorest half of American society now earns the same as the richest 0.1%.</p>
<p>A huge part of the problem with multi-national corporations is that they will exploit weak regulatory systems in the U.S and other countries to engage in cost cutting measures such as wage theft, infringements on the right to collective organization, forced child labor, and other violations of human/labor rights. Moreover, corporate culture with its hierarchical organizational structure tends to reproduce many of the inequalities which women and minorities experience outside of the workplace.</p>
<p>The University of Illinois specifically is invested in some of the most egregious violators of labor rights, including corporations such as Tyson Foods which uses their workers’ undocumented status as a means of blackmailing them into silence about the company’s unethical and illegal practices. Companies operating in Israel are also known to exploit the labor of undocumented Palestinians and African migrants alike, because of the few legal protections afforded to them by the state.</p>

				<h4>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</h4> <br />
				<p>
<body>
<p>Two years ago the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign pledged to reduce its environmental footprint as part of its 2015 Climate Action Plan. As a public research institution, the university must play a leading role in developing and implementing strategies for sustainable growth including meeting the ever-growing demand for food, water, and fuel. We must also recognize that environmental justice is an essential part of many liberation struggles, including that of Palestine.  </p>
<p>Recognizing the intersections between environmental and social justice, we can’t allow the general push for sustainability to become hijacked by reactionary forces claiming to act in its interests. One such organization is the JNF (Jewish National Fund), a staunchly Zionist organization that has played an important role in erasing the indigenous character of Palestine by clearing thousands of acres of biodiverse native habitat and replacing them with non-native pine forests. Currently, the JNF is complicit in a massive “relocation” of 40,000-70,000 of the Bedouin living in the Negev region of southern Israel. It is building parks over the ruins of Bedouin villages that would only be accessible to nearby Jewish settlements. In fact, it is using the very same equipment that Caterpillar supplies to the IDF, which the IDF uses to bury alive Palestinians in their homes in order to make room for future waves of settlers.     </p>
<p>Israel is not alone in physically altering native habitats in order to “Europeanize” them and erase all signs of indigenous habitation. Similarly, the Mid-West <g class="gr_ gr_107 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="107" data-gr-id="107">was once host</g> to a biologically rich prairie ecosystem, but in the last hundred or so years white settlers have completely erased all traces of this and instead established monocultures of corn, soy, and wheat. Moreover, corporate farm operators (now <g class="gr_ gr_108 gr-alert gr_spell gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="108" data-gr-id="108">omni-present</g> in the Mid-West) like Tyson Foods are among the largest polluters of waterways in the United States. They are also some of the main contributors to the formation of hypoxic zones in the Gulf of Mexico that threaten the survival of many ecosystems and the livelihoods for millions of people.</p>
<p>Other companies expanding their operations into biologically sensitive areas are pipeline companies such as Enbridge. Beyond simply the direct impacts of oil spills, the expansion of pipelines also promote the growth of the most carbon intensive forms of energy production. Recently proposed pipeline such as the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) would also threaten the water supply of thousands of indigenous people and destroy sites of spiritual importance. The same financial institutions, such as CitiGroup, that are putting money into DAPL and other pipeline projects are also funding destructive coal mining practices in Appalachia. Companies like ExxonMobil also continue to finance climate change denial in spite of the overwhelming scientific consensus.</p>
