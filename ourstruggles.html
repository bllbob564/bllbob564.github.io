				<h4>CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BORDER CONTROL</h4> <br />
				<p>

<body>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong>  States’ corrections spending since 1987 has more than doubled, higher education spending has barely grown. Over a period of thirty <g class="gr_ gr_187 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="187" data-gr-id="187">years</g> the U.S prison population has risen by 700%.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> Nearly half of all inmates in state prisons are locked up for nonviolent offenses (a testament to the <g class="gr_ gr_63 gr-alert gr_spell gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="63" data-gr-id="63">so called</g> “War on Drugs”). This phenomenon, known as mass incarceration particularly affects poor communities of color.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> Mass incarceration has been enabled by policing policies such as stop and frisk that have given law enforcement a legal pretext to kidnap hundreds of thousands of young people, pressing them into service in the prison industry.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> Incarcerated workers are frequently denied their basic rights, forced to work for ten times less than the already unlivable federal minimum wage while private corporations profit by the cheap labor and high markup for goods and services they charge to inmates.</p>
<p><strong><g class="gr_ gr_104 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="104" data-gr-id="104">WHEREAS,</g></strong> Recidivism rates show the carceral system does not aim to rehabilitate, it aims to force the most vulnerable within our society into an inescapable cycle of poverty and exploitation by the state.</p>
<p><strong><g class="gr_ gr_111 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="111" data-gr-id="111">WHEREAS,</g></strong> Mass incarceration is not simply a class or racial issue, it is an LGBTQ issue given the disproportionate representation of queer people, particularly queer people of color, in the incarcerated population.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> Black and indigenous trans-people are respectively more than 10 and 7 times more likely to be imprisoned at some point in their life than the general population, which is more than 7 and 5 times higher than their non-trans counterparts. LGBTQ individuals as a whole are several times more likely to experience police harassment and 3 to 4 times more likely to experience sexual assault while in prison.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> The high incidence of sexual abuse and other violations is not exclusive to citizen prisons. It is also commonplace in immigrant detention centers where some 200,000 detainees are placed in overcrowded cells deprived of legal counsel.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> Detainees are often threatened with deportation if they complain about the conditions of their confinement, which makes them even more vulnerable.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> Many of the same corporations operating citizen prisons operate immigrant detention centers on behalf of ICE, the federal agency entrusted with what’s termed “border security”.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> The “border security complex” extends beyond the walls of the detention centers, with Israeli companies such as Elbit supplying the surveillance systems that U.S Homeland Security uses to hunt down people who attempt to cross the border.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> This same border which has led to the internment of thousands of people has only existed for the past hundred years, but has in that time undermined indigenous claims to the land that go back thousands of years.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> The arbitrary placement of borders by European colonial powers is a commonly repeated theme in history, including that of Palestine.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> Whereas the same methods used to limit the freedom of movement of Palestinians in the West Bank,  has been used on the U.S-Mexico border.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> The private sector plays a crucial role in legitimizing all these aspects of <g class="gr_ gr_54 gr-alert gr_spell gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="54" data-gr-id="54">state sponsored</g> oppression which surrounds both border control and the carceral system.    </p>
<p><br /><strong>BE IT RESOLVED,</strong> The commonalities between the prison industry and immigrant detention industry are so strong that they ought to be grouped together, and our university ought to move forward to fully divest from private prison/immigrant detention center operators and suppliers. These corporations are perpetuating a legacy of racial, class, and gendered <g class="gr_ gr_70 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="70" data-gr-id="70">discrimination,</g> and their complicity cannot continue to go unpunished.</p>

				<h4>TRANSNATIONAL LABOR SOLIDARITY</h4> <br />
				<p>
<body>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> Neoliberal reforms of the last thirty years have led to a more interconnected global economy and contributed to the growth of massive multi-national corporations.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> The threat of jobs being outsourced has been used to reverse many of the labor gains achieved in the U.S over the last sixty years. Real wages and union membership <g class="gr_ gr_212 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="212" data-gr-id="212">has</g> declined, while wealth inequality has more than tripled since 1980. The bottom poorest half of American society now earns the same as the richest 0.1%.    </p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> Multi-national corporations will exploit weak regulatory systems to engage in cost cutting measures such as forced child labor, wage theft, infringements on the right to assembly, and other violations of human/labor rights.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> Corporate culture with its hierarchical organizational structure reproduces many of the inequalities which women and minorities experience outside of the workplace.</p>
<p><strong><g class="gr_ gr_220 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="220" data-gr-id="220">WHEREAS,</g></strong> Labor represents the vast majority of the populace, including the most disenfranchised, and an attack on the rights of the worker is an injury to all.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> The University of Illinois is invested in some of the most egregious violators of labor rights, including corporations such as Tyson Foods which uses their workers’ undocumented status as a means of blackmailing them into silence about the company’s unethical and illegal practices.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> Israeli companies are also known to use undocumented Palestinians and African migrants alike because of the few legal protections afforded to them by the state.     </p>
<p><strong>BE IT RESOLVED,</strong> Our university <g class="gr_ gr_209 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace" id="209" data-gr-id="209">divest</g> from corporations that are most working to undermine the labor movement through lobbying for legislative changes that compromise the rights of the worker and that deny their workers the bare minimum, including safe working conditions and living wages.</p>

				<h4>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</h4> <br />
				<p>
<body>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> The University of Illinois at <g class="gr_ gr_269 gr-alert gr_spell gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="269" data-gr-id="269">Urbana Champaign</g> has pledged to reduce its environmental footprint as part of its 2015 Climate Action Plan.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> The University of Illinois as a public research institution must play a leading role in developing and implementing strategies for sustainable growth including meeting the ever-growing demand for food, water, and energy.   </p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> Environmental justice is an essential part of many liberation struggles, including in Palestine.  </p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> So-called “environmentalist”, Zionist-run organizations such as the JNF (Jewish National Fund) have played an important role in erasing the indigenous character of Palestine by clearing thousands of acres of biodiverse native habitat replacing them with non-native pine forests.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> The JNF is currently complicit in a massive “relocation” of 40,000-70,000 of the Bedouin living in the Negev region of southern Israel. It is building parks over the ruins of Bedouin villages that would only be accessible to nearby Jewish settlements.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> The JNF is using the very same equipment that Caterpillar supplies to the IDF, which it uses to bury alive Palestinians in their homes to make room for future waves of settlers.     </p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> The U.S has used similar tactics as the JNF to physically alternative habitats in order to “Europeanize” <g class="gr_ gr_366 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="366" data-gr-id="366">them,</g> while erasing all signs of indigenous habitation.</p>
<p><strong><g class="gr_ gr_380 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="380" data-gr-id="380">WHEREAS,</g></strong> The Mid-West <g class="gr_ gr_276 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="276" data-gr-id="276">was once host</g> to a biologically rich prairie ecosystem, but white settlers have completely erased all traces of this and instead established monocultures of corn, soy, and wheat.  </p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> Agri-businesses like Tyson Foods are among the largest polluters of in the United States, which has led to the formation of hypoxic zones in the Gulf of Mexico that threaten the survival of many ecosystems and the livelihoods for millions.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> Pipeline companies like Enbridge are expanding their operations into biologically sensitive areas, and promoting the growth of the most carbon intensive forms of energy production.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> Multinational financial institutions are putting money into destructive coal mining practices in Appalachia while companies like ExxonMobil continue to finance climate change denial in spite of the overwhelming scientific consensus.</p>
<p><strong><g class="gr_ gr_287 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="287" data-gr-id="287">WHEREAS,</g></strong> Groups such as CitiBank also finance the expansion of major pipelines, such as DAPL, that would threaten the water supply of thousands of indigenous people and destroy sites of spiritual importance.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> Corporate and state disregard for the most vital resource, water, has enabled a company like Nestle to extract billions of gallons every year from California aquifers that it sells for a huge markup to communities like Flint, MI, where municipal authorities have shut down the water supply for millions of people.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> Corporations make astronomical profits on the privatization of a public good at the expense of the poorest Americans, similar to how Israeli settlements profit from the state annexation of Palestinian water supplies at the expense of Palestinians.</p>
<p><strong>BE IT RESOLVED,</strong> The University of Illinois divest from companies that are perpetuating the worst environmental injustices. This includes but is not limited to building and financing pipelines through indigenous lands, <g class="gr_ gr_278 gr-alert gr_spell gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="278" data-gr-id="278">privatizating</g> water supplies, emitting huge volumes of <g class="gr_ gr_279 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="279" data-gr-id="279">pollutant</g> into the atmosphere and waterways, and supplying the equipment used to evict native peoples from their homes and colonize their lands.</p>
