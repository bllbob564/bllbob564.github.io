				<h4>PALESTINE</h4> <br />
				<p>

<body>
<p><strong></strong>Palestine is a relatively small nation in the Middle East located to the west of Jordan and north of Egypt. It has a rich, complicated history and hosts some of the most important sites of worship for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Palestine has been under occupation by a variety of foreign powers. Beginning in 1923 following the ratification of the Sykes–Picot Agreement, which divided up the Middle East and allocated portions of it between the French and the British, Palestine became an extension of the British empire. During the British occupation there was a massive wave of Jewish refugees entering the region from Europe. What brought these refugees fleeing persecution in their home countries to Palestine was their inability to enter other countries, principally the U.S, which had implemented strict racial quotas on the number of people allowed to immigrate.</p>
<p>These refugees who entered Palestine received substantial legal and financial support from outside backers, not just Jewish groups, but governments and powerfully connected individuals in Europe and the U.S as well, who wanted to motivate their Jewish population to emigrate. Within a few years of the British Mandate Jews came to make up 33% of the population of Palestine, a three-fold jump from just 25 years before. While Palestine has long been host to an indigenous Mizrahi Jewish population, the sudden influx of European Jews purchasing land, evicting peasant farmers, and coming to dominate the political landscape led to widespread fears that the Zionists, those who claim to advocate for a Jewish state, would make good on their promises to “expel the Arabs and take their place”, as David Ben-Gurion, the first prime minister of Israel put it.</p>
<p>In 1948 the British withdrew from Palestine, and a Jewish state was declared. The immediate result of the establishment of Israel was a mass exodus of native Palestinians from their homeland. Up to 700,000 fled many of whom were evicted from their homes at gunpoint. In subsequent years the refugee population grew as Israeli settlers began making further inroads into Palestinian land, displacing local residents in the process. The total refugee population is now estimated at more than 5 million. Today, Israeli Jews make up roughly half of the population of Palestine while occupying 78% of its land.</p>
<p>The remaining Palestinians who haven’t fled are made to live on less than ⅕ th of their historic homeland (mainly made up of the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip), and the amount of land left for them continues to dwindle with Israeli policies that favor the economic isolation, fragmentation, and political subordination of indigenous Palestine. In the last thirty years hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers have moved into the occupied territories, more than tripling the settler population in the West Bank and doubling the settler population in East Jerusalem. Consequently, 40% of the occupied West Bank is now off-limits to Palestinians and only 18% of it is effectively governed by Palestinians. Conditions in Gaza, one of the densest places on Earth, aren’t any better with a crippling economic blockade and repeated bombing of Palestinian homes and infrastructure by Israel probably leading it to become “uninhabitable by 2020” according to a recent UN report. The international community has condemned Israel numerous times for its flagrant human rights violations but this hasn’t stopped the U.S or U.S companies from knowingly funding, normalizing, and militarizing the Israeli occupation.</p>

				<h4>MASS INCARCERATION</h4> <br />
				<p>

<body>
<p><strong></strong>Since 1987 states’ corrections spending in the U.S has more than doubled, while higher education spending has remained stagnant. Concurrently, the U.S has also experienced increased arrest and conviction rates among the youth, which also reflects what is happening in Palestine. Over a period of thirty years the U.S prison population has increased by 700%, while in Palestine the number of children detained by Israeli security forces has more than doubled since last year. Nearly half of all inmates in state prisons are locked up for nonviolent offenses (a testament to the so called “War on Drugs”). This phenomenon of growing arrest and conviction rates, known as mass incarceration, particularly affects poor communities of color. Mass incarceration has been enabled by policing policies such as stop and frisk in the U.S and the Prevention of Infiltration Law in Israel that have given law enforcement a legal pretext to kidnap hundreds of thousands of young people, pressing them into service in the prison industry and stripping them of their dignity.</p>
<p>Incarcerated workers are frequently denied their basic rights, forced to work for less than half the already unlivable national minimum wage while private corporations profit by the cheap labor and high markup for goods and services they charge to inmates. In Israel incarcerated workers earn on average 30% less than the national minimum wage, however Palestinians, which make up 60% of those incarcerated in Israeli prisons, make even less due to laws that limit access to vocational training and degree earning programs to those imprisoned for “terrorism” offenses. Recidivism rates furthermore show that the carceral system does not aim to rehabilitate, it aims to force the most vulnerable within our societies into an inescapable cycle of poverty and exploitation by the state.</p>
<p>Moreover, mass incarceration is not simply a class or racial issue, it is an LGBTQ issue given the disproportionate representation of queer people, particularly queer people of color, in the incarcerated population. Black and indigenous trans people are respectively more than 10 and 7 times more likely to be imprisoned at some point in their life than the general population, which is more than 7 and 5 times higher than their non-trans counterparts. Meanwhile in Israel, trans people face many of the same issues that they do in the U.S surrounding lack of acceptance by families, homelessness, and elevated risk of HIV/AIDS. Israeli prisons are particularly not a safe place for trans people, with inmates frequently misgendered and placed in prisons corresponding to the gender they were assigned at birth or placed in solitary confinement, which jeopardizes their safety and mental health.  In the U.S, LGBTQ individuals as a whole are several times more likely to experience police harassment and 3 to 4 times more likely to experience sexual assault while in prison. Comparable rates exist in Israel.</p>

				<h4>BORDER CONTROL</h4> <br />
				<p>
<body>
<p>The high incidence of sexual abuse and other violations is not exclusive to citizen prisons. In fact, it is also commonplace in immigrant detention centers where some 200,000 detainees in the U.S are placed in overcrowded cells deprived of legal counsel. Detainees are often threatened with deportation if they complain about the conditions of their confinement, which makes them even more vulnerable. Moreover, many of the same companies operating citizen prisons, such as Sodexo, operate immigrant detention centers on behalf of ICE, the U.S federal agency entrusted with “border security”. The political argument for “border security” has furthermore been invoked in Israel, to treat refugees fleeing from instability in Eritrea and Sudan, as criminals, detaining them for up to three years without trial.</p>
<p>This industry that surrounds “border security” extends beyond the walls of the detention centers, with Israeli companies such as Elbit supplying the surveillance systems that U.S Homeland Security uses to hunt down people who attempt to cross the border. This same border which has led to the internment of thousands of people and separated countless families has only existed for the past hundred years, but has undermined indigenous claims to the land that go back thousands of years. The arbitrary placement of borders by European colonial powers on indigenous land is a commonly repeated theme throughout history, including that of Palestine. Furthermore, the same methods used to limit the freedom of movement of Palestinians in the West Bank,  has been used on the U.S-Mexico border. One company particularly well-known for supporting these methods is HP, who is responsible for operating and maintaining the Israeli ID system that marks “Jew” from “non-Jew” and enables the Israeli government to enforce restrictions on their “non-Jewish” population.</p>

				<h4>TRANSNATIONAL LABOR SOLIDARITY</h4> <br />
				<p>
<body>
<p>Neoliberal reforms of the last thirty years have led to a more interconnected global economy but has also contributed to the growth of massive multi-national corporations. They have magnified the threat of “job outsourcing”, which has been used to reverse many of the labor gains achieved in the U.S over the last sixty years. Wealth inequality has more than tripled since 1980, while real wages and union membership continue to decline. The bottom poorest half of American society now earns the same as the richest 0.1%. Israel has similar wealth inequality issues, with Arabs earning on average 80% less than Israeli born Jews.</p>
<p>A huge part of the problem with multi-national corporations is that they will exploit weak regulatory systems in the U.S and other countries to engage in cost cutting measures such as wage theft, infringements on the right to collective organization, forced child labor, and other violations of human/labor rights. In the U.S the group most affected by these labor violations are poor, communities of color while in Israel it is Palestinians. Moreover, corporate culture with its hierarchical organizational structure tends to reproduce many of the inequalities which women and minorities experience outside of the workplace.</p>
<p>The University of Illinois specifically is invested in some of the most egregious violators of labor rights, including corporations such as Tyson Foods which uses their workers’ undocumented status as a means of blackmailing them into silence about the company’s unethical and illegal practices. Companies operating in Israel are also known to exploit the labor of undocumented Palestinians and African migrants alike, because of the few legal protections afforded to them by the state.</p>

				<h4>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</h4> <br />
				<p>
<body>
<p>Two years ago the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign pledged to reduce its
environmental footprint as part of its 2015 Climate Action Plan. As a public research institution, the university must play a leading role in developing and implementing strategies for sustainable growth including meeting the ever-growing demand for food, water, and fuel. We must also recognize that environmental justice is an essential part of many liberation struggles, including that of Palestine.</p>
<p>Recognizing the intersections between environmental and social justice, we can’t allow the general push for sustainability to become hijacked by reactionary forces claiming to act in its interests. One such organization is the JNF (Jewish National Fund), a strongly Zionist organization that has played an important role in erasing the indigenous character of Palestine by clearing thousands of acres of biodiverse native habitat	and replacing them with non-native pine forests. Currently, the JNF is complicit in a massive “relocation” of 40,000-70,000 of the Bedouin living in the Negev region of southern Israel. It is building parks over the
ruins of Bedouin villages that would only be accessible to nearby Jewish settlements. In fact, it is using the very same equipment that Caterpillar supplies to the IDF, which the IDF uses to bury alive Palestinians in their homes to make room for future waves of settlers.</p>
<p>Israel is not alone in physically altering native habitats in order to “Europeanize” them. Similarly, the Mid-West was once host to a biologically rich prairie ecosystem, but in the last hundred or so years white settlers have completely erased all traces of this and instead established monocultures of corn, soy, and wheat. Moreover, corporate farm operators (now omni-present in the Mid-West) like Tyson Foods are among the largest polluters of waterways in the United States. They are also some of the main contributors to the formation of hypoxic zones in the Gulf of Mexico that threaten the survival of many ecosystems and the livelihoods for millions of people.</p>
<p>Other companies expanding their operations into biologically sensitive areas are pipeline companies such as Enbridge. Beyond simply the direct impacts of oil spills, the expansion of pipelines also promote the growth of the most carbon intensive forms of energy production. Recently proposed pipelines such as the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) would also threaten the water supply of thousands of indigenous people and destroy sites of spiritual importance. Strategic control of hydro-carbon deposits, such as natural gas fields off the coast of Gaza, have also given further economic motivation for the military occupation. Moreover, the same financial institutions, such as CitiGroup, that are putting money into DAPL and other pipeline projects are also funding destructive coal mining practices in places like Appalachia. Companies like ExxonMobil also continue to finance climate change denial in spite of the overwhelming scientific consensus.</p>
<P>Corporate and state disregard for the most vital resource, water, has enabled a company like Nestle to extract billions of gallons of water every year from California aquifers that it sells for a huge markup to communities like Flint, MI, where municipal authorities have shut down the water supply for thousands of people. Corporations are making astronomical profits on the privatization of a public good at the expense of the poorest Americans. In many ways this is similar to how Israeli settlements profit from the state annexation of Palestinian water supplies, and more indirectly how businesses profit from the growing privatization of higher education.</P>

				<h4>MILITARISM</h4> <br />
				<p>
<body>
<p>Stated simply, the United States of America is a chief aggressor in international conflicts and has been so since its conception as a settler-colonial state that has actively sought the eradication of native peoples which had the misfortune of living on land claimed by white colonizers. This is very much analogous to Israel’s history. Linked to this history of state sponsored aggression is a history of private companies profiting from said aggression. The American invasion of Cuba in the 1890’s for instance, which saw the creation of the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, was in part motivated by the profiteering journalism of businessmen like Hearst and Pulitzer, who saw the conflict as an opportunity to sell newspapers by inflaming public opinion against Spain. Moreover, many companies on this list which we want to divest from, such as Caterpillar and Boeing, became so large and well-known through their close dealings with the military.</p>
<p>Private companies historically have enabled and facilitated the militaristic agendas of governments like that of the United States and Israel. To this day many private companies continue to profit on an industry dedicated to killing as many people as efficiently as possible. In the last Iraq war private defense contractors actually outnumbered U.S soldiers on the ground and total defense spending amounted to more than 1.1 trillion USD by the war’s end. Israel’s privatized defense industry, on the other hand, has led to it becoming the sixth largest arms exporter in the world accounting for 10% of total world exports. The political and economic repercussions of the U.S and Israel’s destabilization of the Middle East and other areas continue to resonate. Wars which the U.S specifically entered into under false pretenses have led to the destruction of millions of innocent lives among the countries that the U.S has gone to war against and among the communities in which young poor Americans are called upon to be used as cannon fodder. We must hold private companies responsible just as we would hold our own government.</p>
