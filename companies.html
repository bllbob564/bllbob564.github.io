				<h4>Motorola Solutions Inc.</h4> <br />
				<p>
Motorola Solutions is an American communications equipment company and the parent company of Motorola Solutions Israel. Motorola provides the MotoEagle Surveillance system, a "virtual fence" that detects human movement using radars and cameras, to 25 illegal Israeli settlements, the West Bank separation wall, the Israel-Gaza barrier, and Israeli military bases. These systems are often mounted on private Palestinian land and restrict Palestinians' freedom of movement. Motorola also supplies the Israeli army and Israel Police with communication systems. In 2014, Motorola received a $100 million, 15 year contract to develop and supply encrypted smartphones for the Israeli army and other security forces. Half of the funding for the smartphone program will come from U.S. military aid to Israel. Motorola provides Internet access to Israel Railways trains and stations. The A1 Israel Railways route illegally crosses into the West Bank and passes through private Palestinian land.

				<h4>G4S PLC</h4> <br />
				<p>
G4S is a British security company that operates worldwide. In March 2016, G4S announced plans to sell its Israel subsidary (with the exception of its stake in a new police training center) and is still in the process of doing so. In Palestine/Israel, G4S provides services to prisons that violate international law by detaining Palestinian political prisoners in Israel, to interrogation facilities where prisoners are tortured, to checkpoints that restrict Palestinians’ freedom of movement, and to illegal West Bank settlements. In 2012, the UN Special Rapporteur listed G4S as one of the main companies profitting from settlements. G4S owns and operates Mangaung Correctional Centre in South Africa, the second largest private prison in the world. In 2013, the Wits Justice Project uncovered evidence of torture at the prison, which included electric shocks and forced injections. In 2015, evidence emerged of prisoner deaths resulting from such torture, which the prison had documented as resulting from natural causes or suicide. Since 2006, G4S has provided transportation services to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, transporting undocumented immigrants to detention centers and expelling them from the United States.

				<h4>Sodexo</h4> <br />
				<p>
Sodexo is one of the largest food services and facilities management companies in the world. It operates 87 prisons throughout Europe and South America and makes 700 million dollars every year (3.3% of its total revenue) from the prison and immigrant detention industry. Sodexo is also infamous for overcharging public agencies and in 2010 was forced to pay a 20 million dollar settlement to New York school districts for inflating prices by as much as 15% of their market value. State and federal investigations into Sodexo have revealed a  nationwide pattern of fraud, “serious” employee safety violations, prohibitions on collective bargaining, racial discrimination, and violations of the rights of prison inmates.

				<h4>Citigroup</h4> <br />
				<p>
Citigroup is a multinational investment banking and financial services corporation with some 16,000 offices worldwide managing 1.8 trillion dollars in assets. Over the last ten years Citigroup in addition to other Wall Street banks have been on the spotlight for their role in the sub-prime mortgage crisis by enabling predatory lending practices, lying to shareholders, purchasing fraudulent mortgages, and firing tens of thousands of employees at the outset of the global economic recession. Citigroup is also the second largest global financier of coal, having invested 15 billion dollars in coal mining and coal power plants from 2005 to 2011. Although, Citigroup has as of 2015 pledged to reduce its exposure to coal, it continues to finance destructive mining practices in Central Appalachia. It also has broken its own promise of respecting the needs of indigenous peoples through its critical role in financing the Dakota Access Pipeline and paving the way for other banks to join the project.

				<h4>Nestle</h4> <br />
				<p>
Nestle is a trans-national food and drink company based in Switzerland. As the largest food company in the world, Nestle has a responsibility to prevent supply chain abuses within their industry. Unfortunately, more than ten years after pledging to end its reliance on the worst forms of child labor, Nestle is still under investigation for knowingly sourcing its cocoa from farms that are engaged in child trafficking and using forced child labor. These practices are widespread in the cocoa industry with an estimated 1.1 million child laborers living in what a report last year described as “slave-like conditions”, spurred on by the refusal of Nestle to pay its farmers living wages. Nestle’s exploitation of cheap labor extends to South America, where it has used heavy handed methods, including working with drug cartels, to prevent its workers from unionizing. Nestle has also exploited weak regulatory systems in places such as drought stricken California to extract billions of gallons of water from public aquifers while selling it at an obscene markup. Communities like Flint, Michigan where clean water is not available may spend as much as 10% or more of their income on bottled water because of Nestle’s opportunism.

				<h4>Enbridge Inc</h4> <br />
				<p>
Enbridge Inc. is an energy delivery company based in Canada. It operates the longest crude oil and hydrocarbon transportation system in the world, which is alarming considering its history of building in environmentally sensitive areas without taking necessary precautions to prevent spills. In fact, over a period of little more than 10 years from 1999 to 2010 Enbridge has been responsible for at least 804 spills that have released 161,475 barrels of oil into the environment. It is also at the forefront of new pipeline initiatives that threaten water security, indigenous sovereignty, biodiversity, and long-term climate stability. Its proposed Northern Gateway pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific coast would enable an expansion in tar sands oil production that would lead to an additional 6.5 megatonnes of greenhouse gas being emitted annually, 8.4 billion gallons of processing water being consumed every year, and 120 million gallons of toxic wastewater entering Alberta watersheds. It plans to continue with this proposed pipeline despite lacking the support of a single indigenous tribe on whose land this pipeline would transverse. Unsurprisingly, Enbridge also has a 28% equity stake in the Bakken Pipeline System, which includes the Dakota Access Pipeline.

				<h4>Mizrahi Tefahot Bank Ltd.</h4> <br />
				<p>
Mizrahi Tefahot Bank is the fourth largest bank in Israel and its largest mortgage lender. In addition to providing mortgages for homebuyers in the settlements is also one of the largest providers of financing for housing projects in the occupied territories. It has financed no fewer than twenty major construction projects in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem that have led to hundreds of housing units being built able to accommodate thousands of new settlers. It also has several branches that operate in the settlements. As matter of policy Mizrahi Tefahot Bank does not to provide credit to Palestinian citizens of Israel to discourage them from opening accounts with the bank. This is a violation of Israeli law and the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid, which prohibits measures that are calculated to prevent a racial group or groups from the participation in the political, social, economic and cultural life of a country.

				<h4>ExxonMobil Corporation</h4> <br />
				<p>
ExxonMobil is the world’s largest publicly-traded oil and gas company and the world’s largest refiner and marketer of petroleum products. With less than 1% of their profits spent on alternative energy research there is no denying that Exxon has a material interest in maintaining the world’s addiction to fossil fuels. Since the 1980’s it has spent tens of millions of dollars lobbying for climate change denial, and remains one of the world’s largest contributors to airborne pollution and biodiversity loss. Exxon is also responsible for a variety of human rights abuses. For over twenty years it contracted the Indonesian military to “defend” its gas fields in the region of Aceh in northern Sumatra from independence forces by terrorizing the indigenous population. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has since called on Exxon to be held accountable for its egregious violations of international law and Exxon is currently awaiting trial for its sanctioning of torture and collective punishment against Acehnese villages. Exxon is also literally fueling the Israeli occupation. Since 2003 it has been one of the Israel Defense Forces’ chief suppliers, and much of the fuel Exxon sells to the IDF is specifically designated for use by its fleet of attack helicopters, fighter planes, and tanks.

Tyson is an American based company, the world’s largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork. Tyson has a history of violating the rights of their workers, their animals, and the environment. It is heavily reliant on undocumented labor because of their vulnerability under U.S immigration law, and in 2001 was indicted by a Federal District Court on 36 counts of facilitating human smuggling across the U.S-Mexico border. Plant managers for Tyson regularly exploit fears of deportation and detention by undocumented workers to coerce them to work faster and longer hours, often without pay. It is not uncommon for managers to use workers’ immigration status as a way of blackmailing them to keep silent about the plant’s health and safety violations, incidents of job discrimination, workplace injuries and illnesses, and violations of U.S labor law. Tyson is also known for brutally mistreating their animals as revealed by undercover investigations which have shown birds being scalded alive and improperly slaughtered because of the rapid pace of operations. Their record on environmental issues is no less redeeming as according to the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory, Tyson is the second largest polluter of waterways in the U.S having discharged 104 million pounds of pollutants from 2010 to 2014. Its activities have not only compromised many communities’ drinking water but have indirectly contributed to the formation of hypoxic zones in the Gulf of Mexico that have threatened fisheries and the livelihoods of millions living along the coast.

				<h4>Elbit</h4> <br />
				<p>
Elbit is an Israel based defense company that specializes in manufacturing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems, electro-optic systems, and communication systems. Elbit is a company which has profited heavily off the occupation and Israeli wars of aggression as one of Israel’s most dependable weapons suppliers. In 2012 it processed a 120 million dollar order for the Hermes 900, a UAV which was used extensively by the Israeli Air Force (IAF) to support ground military actions during the 2014 Assault on Gaza. It also supplies the IAF with combat training systems that it used to great effectiveness in its targeted bombing of homes, elementary schools, and civilian infrastructure. While Elbit saw its profits and share prices rise, the 2014 Israeli Invasion is credited for having left a third of the Palestinian population in Gaza homeless, over a thousand children permanently disabled, and over two thousand Palestinians dead (70% of whom were civilians). Elbit in addition to operating a facility in the settlements is also a main provider of surveillance systems for the Israeli-West Bank barrier. It also is a leading supplier of surveillance systems for the U.S-Mexico border, and in 2014 won a 145 million dollar contract from the U.S Department of Homeland Security to provide a massive upgrade to their existing camera and radar systems along the border.
